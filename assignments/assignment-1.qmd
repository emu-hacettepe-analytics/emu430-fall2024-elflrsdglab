# Assignment 1

```{r}
1 + 1
```

My first assignment has two parts.

## (a)

The video I watched : [Veri Bilimi ve Endüstri Mühendisliği Üzerine Sohbetler - Cem Vardar & Erdi Dasdemir]

The video features Cem Vardar, an industrial engineer who earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Turkey and his doctorate in the 

United States. He has worked actively in data science and shares his experiences and knowledge. Vardar provides many helpful insights into 

data science and its importance in the industry.

## Questions

### Open-ended Question

Why are industrial engineers needed in complex systems?

### Answer 

Industrial engineers are important in complex systems because they ensure that parts like logistics, marketing, and scheduling work well 

together. They focus on the interactions between these elements, using scheduling and sequencing to improve efficiency and keep everything 

running smoothly.

### Multiple Choice Question 

What is it called when knowing 20% of something provides you with 80% of the benefits?

A) Data Warehousing

B) Silo

C) Pareto Principle

D) Information Systems

E) Extract/Transform/Load

### Answer

The answer is Pareto Principle. The Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, suggests that roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of

causes. In other words, knowing a small portion of information can lead to most of the benefits or results.
